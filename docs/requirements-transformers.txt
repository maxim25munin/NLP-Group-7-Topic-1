# Optional dependencies required to run the XLM-R baseline in
# scripts/evaluate_language_id_baselines.py and
# scripts/evaluate_ood_xlmr_vs_fasttext.py. Install with:
#   pip install -r requirements-transformers.txt
#
# The CPU-only PyTorch build is sufficient for the evaluation script, but feel
# free to install a GPU-enabled build if your hardware supports it.
torch>=2.1.0
transformers>=4.45.0
# huggingface_hub 1.x requires a reasonably recent transformers build. Pair hub
# releases >=1.0.0 with transformers>=4.45.0. If you're stuck on an older
# transformers version, pin the hub dependency below 1.0.0 instead.
