# Optional dependencies required to run the XLM-R baseline in
# scripts/evaluate_language_id_baselines.py and
# scripts/evaluate_ood_xlmr_vs_fasttext.py. Install with:
#   pip install -r requirements-transformers.txt
#
# The CPU-only PyTorch build is sufficient for the evaluation script, but feel
# free to install a GPU-enabled build if your hardware supports it.
torch>=2.1.0
transformers>=4.45.0
# The XLM-R baseline requires the Hugging Face Hub client. Versions 0.34.0 and
# newer are compatible with recent ``transformers`` releases (4.45.0+). Older
# hub builds lack APIs that ``transformers`` relies on and will fail at import
# time.
