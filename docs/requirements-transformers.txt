# Optional dependencies required to run the XLM-R baseline in
# scripts/evaluate_language_id_baselines.py and
# scripts/evaluate_ood_xlmr_vs_fasttext.py. Install with:
#   pip install -r requirements-transformers.txt
#
# The CPU-only PyTorch build is sufficient for the evaluation script, but feel
# free to install a GPU-enabled build if your hardware supports it.
torch>=2.1.0
transformers>=4.45.0
# Transformers currently expect ``huggingface_hub`` releases below 1.0.0. If you
# already have a hub 1.x release installed, downgrade it to a compatible build
# with ``pip install -U "huggingface_hub<1.0.0"`` before running the baseline.
huggingface_hub>=0.34.0,<1.0.0
datasets>=2.16.0
accelerate>=0.27.0
