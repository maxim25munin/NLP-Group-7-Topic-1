# Optional dependencies required to run the XLM-R baseline in
# scripts/evaluate_language_id_baselines.py and
# scripts/evaluate_ood_xlmr_vs_fasttext.py. Install with:
#   pip install -r requirements-transformers.txt
#
# The CPU-only PyTorch build is sufficient for the evaluation script, but feel
# free to install a GPU-enabled build if your hardware supports it.

# The XLM-R baseline requires the Hugging Face Hub client. Versions in the
# 0.34.x–0.99.x range are compatible with recent ``transformers`` releases
# (4.45.0+). Older hub builds lack APIs that ``transformers`` relies on and will
# fail at import time, while hub 1.x introduces breaking changes for current
# ``transformers`` releases.
huggingface_hub>=0.34.0,<1.0
