# Optional dependencies required to run the XLM-R baseline in
# scripts/evaluate_language_id_baselines.py and
# scripts/evaluate_ood_xlmr_vs_fasttext.py. Install with:
#   pip install -r requirements-transformers.txt
#
# The CPU-only PyTorch build is sufficient for the evaluation script, but feel
# free to install a GPU-enabled build if your hardware supports it.

transformers>=4.45.0
# The XLM-R baseline requires the Hugging Face Hub client. Versions in the
# 0.34.x+ range are compatible with recent ``transformers`` releases (4.45.0+).
# Older hub builds lack APIs that ``transformers`` relies on and will fail at
# import time. If you are stuck on an older ``transformers`` release (<4.45.0),
# downgrade the hub client to <1.0 or upgrade ``transformers`` to a modern
# version to use hub 1.x safely.
huggingface_hub>=0.34.0,<2.0
